// This patch is a workaround to disable the Sanity Check Warning about parts with Issue#9 shouts.
//
// This is expected to (finally) be tackled down on TweakScals 2.4.4, but until there,
// shove this file somewhere on your GameData (I suggest GameData/__LOCAL/TweakScale/Workarounds)
//
// Remember to remove the file on TweakScale 2.4.4 .

// Workaround to silence Sanity Check warning on parts with the FSbouyancy module
