	RESULTS
	{
		default = Warning: Unable to classify this celestial body. Either the body is not configured and holds no resources, or its report is undefined.
		SunInSpaceHigh = Scan inconclusive. Baseline measurements for Sun stellar medium saved. Report saved.
		SunInSpaceLow = Star classification: Population 1. Metallicity rating: High. Antimatter presence is weak.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Running diagnostics... Scanning... Compiling data... Fuzzy Scan capabilities measured. Report saved.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Running diagnostics... Scanning... Compiling data... Surface classification: Rock; complete. Atmosphere composition: Terra; complete. Kerbin is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials. Ice Caps confirmed to be over 90% Fresh Water. Trace atmosphere profiled: Terra. Farming opportunities available near atmosphere edge.

	@RESULTS:NEEDS[!RationalResourcesAU]
	{
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Metal. This planet is rich in metals, radioactive material and very poor in Ore and Water-bearing materials.
		MohoInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		EveInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Unique. Eve is by far a mineral and Rocky world, with a potential strong balance of many other materials, and seems poor in radioactives.
		EveInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Carbonaceous. Trace atmosphere composition: None. Eve's high gravity may have dragged down anything of value other than Hydrogen.
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Metal. This moon is rich in metals, radioactive material and very poor in Ore and Water-bearing materials.
		GillyInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere composition: None. Gilly is evidently unable to hold onto any considerable amount of materials in the wake of Eve's gravity well.
		
		MunInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Unique. The Mun is inexplicably rich in metals and bound Oxygen.
		MunInSpaceLow = The Mun has a modest store of metals, Minerals, Rock and Gypsum behind its blanket of Oxygen. Detecting highly scattered, highly dense concentrations of Water and rare materials. Further scanning is required. Trace atmosphere profiled: Unique. Oxygen, Rock and Water found.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Unique. Minmus is in fact not composed of ice cream but of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Water-bearing compounds. No metals detected. There may not be a trace atmosphere here.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere not detected. No radioactives detected. Carbon presence is very poor.
		
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Unique. Duna's surface is very rich in radioactives, metals and bound Carbon Dioxide.
		DunaInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Carbon. High presence of Carbon Dioxide followed by Nitrogen. Traces of Rock dust, Ammonia, Oxygen and Water may exist.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Ice. The crust primarily contains Rock and Hydrates. Crustal Oxygen found but with much less abundance than in the Mun.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		DresInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Ice. The crust primarily contains Rock and Hydrates. Crustal Oxygen found but with much less abundance than in the Mun.
		DresInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Atmosphere classification: Jovian. Immense presence of Hydrogen and Helium. Detecting trace Carbon Dioxide. Hydrogen farming can proceed at great distance from the atmosphere edge.
		JoolInSpaceLow = Detecting Nitrous and Hydro type materials... Confirmed. Atmosphere scattering too intense. Cannot probe surface.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Ice. The crust primarily contains Rock and Hydrates. Crustal Oxygen found but cannot yet be explained given Laythe's unique situation. This requires further study.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Terra. Ice Caps confirmed to be over 90% Fresh Water. Trace atmosphere classification: Terra. Farming opportunities available near atmosphere edge.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Water. The great majoity of the crust is free Water and Water-bearing compounds. Detecting Ammonia and other materials which may support Kerbal-kind...
		TyloInSpaceLow:NEEDS[!JNSQ] = Detecting Carbon Dioxide in surface. Detecting traces of metals and radioactives. Trace atmosphere classification: Ice. Detecting Nitrogen and Water in nearby space.
		VallInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Water. The great majoity of the crust is free Water and Water-bearing compounds. Detecting Ammonia and other materials which may support Kerbal-kind...
		VallInSpaceLow = Detecting Carbon Dioxide in surface. Detecting traces of metals and radioactives. Trace atmosphere classification: Ice. Detecting Nitrogen and Water in nearby space.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Water. The great majoity of the crust is free Water and Water-bearing compounds. Detecting Ammonia and other materials which may support Kerbal-kind...
		BopInSpaceLow = Unable to detect sufficient quantities of resources. This body may not have enough gravity to sustain a trace atmosphere.
		PolInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Water. The great majoity of the crust is free Water and Water-bearing compounds. Detecting Ammonia and other materials which may support Kerbal-kind...
		PolInSpaceLow = Unable to detect sufficient quantities of resources. This body may not have enough gravity to sustain a trace atmosphere.
		
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Methane. Detecting concentrations of hydrocarbons and Minerals. Majority of surface is Water and water-bearing compounds. 
		EelooInSpaceLow:NEEDS[!JNSQ] = Trace atmosphere classification: Ice. Detecting Nitrogen and Water in nearby space... Detecting Exotics and Nitrogen... Unable to detect metals and radioactives.
