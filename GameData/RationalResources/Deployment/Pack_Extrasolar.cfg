	@RESULTS
	{
		TeekoInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Nitrogen. Detecting great abundance of crustal Nitrogen and Water. Detecting some life-bearing materials... Proportion of Rock is among the lowest observed yet...
		TeekoInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere classification: Ice. Detecting Nitrogen and Water in nearby space... Detecting Exotics and Nitrogen... Unable to detect metals and radioactives.

		ValentineInSpaceHigh = Scan inconclusive. Baseline measurements for Valentine stellar medium saved. Report saved.
		ValentineInSpaceLow = Star classification: Population 1. Metallicity rating: High. Antimatter presence is weak.

		HebaInSpaceHigh = Atmosphere classification: Jovian. Immense presence of Hydrogen and Helium. Detecting trace Carbon Dioxide. Hydrogen farming can proceed at great distance from the atmosphere edge.
		HebaInSpaceLow = Detecting Nitrous and Hydro type materials... Confirmed. Atmosphere scattering too intense. Cannot probe surface.
		SerexInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Metal. This moon is rich in metals, radioactive material and very poor in Ore and Water-bearing materials.
		SerexInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.

		SolythInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock. This planet is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials.
		SolythInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Terra. Trace atmosphere classification: Terra. Farming opportunities available near atmosphere edge.

		FustInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Water. The great majority of the crust is free Water and Water-bearing compounds. Detecting Ammonia and other materials which may support Kerbal-kind... Detecting unusually high concentrations of Minerals.
		FustInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Terra. Trace atmosphere classification: Terra. Farming opportunities available near atmosphere edge.
		KuprusInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Metal. This moon is rich in metals, radioactive material and very poor in Ore and Water-bearing materials.
		KuprusInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Carbonaceous. Farming opportunities available near atmosphere edge.

		MirInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Ice. The crust primarily contains Rock and Hydrates.
		MirInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Terra. Trace atmosphere classification: Terra. Farming opportunities available near atmosphere edge.

		LominaInSpaceHigh = Atmosphere classification: Uranian. Immense presence of Hydrogen and Helium. Detecting trace Ammonia and Methane. Hydrogen farming can proceed at great distance from the atmosphere edge.
		LominaInSpaceLow = Detecting Carbonaceous and Hydro type materials... Inconclusive. Atmosphere scattering too intense. Cannot probe surface... 		
		MaolInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Water. The great majority of the crust is free Water and Water-bearing compounds. Detecting Ammonia and other materials which may support Kerbal-kind... Detecting unusually high concentrations of Minerals.
		MaolInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere composition: None. Maol is evidently unable to hold onto any considerable amount of materials at this depth in Lominaâ€™s gravity well.
		JavineInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Methane. Detecting concentrations of hydrocarbons and Minerals. Majority of surface is Water and water-bearing compounds.
		JavineInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Ice-Nitrogen. Unable to detect other resources. They must have all frozen out of it. Ocean classification: Cold Mud.
		UcellaInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Water. The great majority of the crust is free Water and Water-bearing compounds. Detecting Ammonia and other materials which may support Kerbal-kind... Detecting unusually high concentrations of Minerals.
		UcellaInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere classification: Ice. Detecting Nitrogen and Water in nearby space... Detecting Exotics and Nitrogen... Unable to detect metals and radioactives.
		DeemoInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Vulcan. The surface is very abundant in Mineral forms, natural combustibles, and organic materials.
		DeemoInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Vulcan. Detecting Hydrogen and Water but primarily Carbons and Nitrogen. Trace atmosphere profiled: Vulcan. Farming opportunities available near atmosphere edge.
		PaelInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Water. The great majority of the crust is free Water and Water-bearing compounds. Detecting Ammonia and other materials which may support Kerbal-kind... Detecting unusually high concentrations of Minerals.
		PaelInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere classification: Ice. Detecting Nitrogen and Water in nearby space... Detecting Exotics and Nitrogen... Unable to detect metals and radioactives.
